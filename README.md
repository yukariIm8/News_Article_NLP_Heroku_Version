# News Article Evaluation with Natural Language Processing

## Project Overview

In this project, I have built a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an application to understand the human language, written or oral.

This repo is the configured version for Netlify. The Full detail of this project is [here](https://github.com/yukariIm8/Udacity_FEND_04_News_Article_NLP).
